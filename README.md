# Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this analysis is to breakdown a local election's voting data to determine a winner by popular vote. The audit included additional steps such as a breakdown of votes per candidate, and voter turnout numbers by county.

## Election Audit Summary

This script can be used to dig deeper into the election data if the dataset had more data points to collect from. As it stands right now, the only meaningful conclusions can be drawn based on the analysis are the number of votes per candidate and the county from which that vote came from. For example if there was an addition data point collected such as polling center, further analysis could be done based on polling stations. Not only could there be analysis done to determine to busiest polling centers, but also those data could be compared to the populations numbers and demographics that those polling stations serve. Therefore, we could then analyze which neighborhoods to target to encourage higher voter turnout. All that would need to change about this script would be additional variables that are populated in a much similar manner as the ones already present.
